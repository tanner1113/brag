# /brag

**You built it. Now brag.**

[![the /brag launch site — you built it, now brag](docs/assets/hero.png)](https://latent-spaces.github.io/brag/)

`/brag` is a Claude Code skill that turns the project you created into a short, shareable launch video — music, motion, and share copy included. One command, powered by [Hyperframes](https://hyperframes.heygen.com/).

The looping video on the [launch site](https://latent-spaces.github.io/brag/) was made by `/brag` on this very repo. 

## New: `/brag-slim`

**The same /brag, rebuilt lean for Opus 5.5.**

A smooth launch video, designed for your specific project, with its own soundtrack and share copy.

No Hyperframes, no bundled assets, same creative rules.

Just tell Opus 5.5: *let's /brag about this.*

On Opus 5.5, `/brag` switches to `/brag-slim` automatically. Run `/brag --full` to keep the classic Hyperframes workflow.

**Install just `/brag-slim`:**

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/latent-spaces/brag --skill brag-slim
```

Already have the `/brag` plugin? `/brag-slim` is included from version 0.4.0. Run `claude plugin update brag` to get it.

## Dickerson Services motion skill

[`skills/dickerson-motion/`](skills/dickerson-motion/SKILL.md) makes Dickerson Services videos in `/brag-slim`'s lean Opus 5.5 mode: before-and-afters, service explainers, seasonal promos, social cuts, lead-gen ads and brand story pieces. On top of `/brag-slim` it adds:

- the brand and tone rules, in `RULES.md` (read first on every run);
- a style guide and shot list that you approve before any render code is written;
- a scored critique loop;
- native renders at 1080×1920, 1080×1080 and 1920×1080 from one timeline;
- cuts timed to measured beats (librosa).

Ask your agent for a Dickerson Services video in this repo and the skill loads from `.claude/skills/` (also `.agents/` and `.opencode/`). Setup for macOS, Linux and Windows 11 is in [`skills/dickerson-motion/INSTALL.md`](skills/dickerson-motion/INSTALL.md).

> **Windows:** those skill folders are symlinks. Clone with `git clone -c core.symlinks=true` with Developer Mode on, or copy `skills/dickerson-motion/` into `.claude/skills/` yourself (see INSTALL.md).

## Install /brag

```bash
/plugin marketplace add latent-spaces/brag
/plugin install brag@brag
```

Then run `/brag` inside any project. The plugin includes `/brag-slim` too.

**Any other agent** — one command via the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI (Cursor, Codex, Copilot, Gemini CLI, opencode, and more):

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/latent-spaces/brag --skill brag
```

Add `-g` to install globally (available in every project); drop it to scope to the current one. ([browse on skills.sh](https://www.skills.sh/latent-spaces/brag/brag))

<details>
<summary>No installer? Copy the skill directly.</summary>

```bash
rsync -a --exclude '.DS_Store' skills/brag/ ~/.claude/skills/brag/
rsync -a --exclude '.DS_Store' skills/brag-slim/ ~/.claude/skills/brag-slim/  # optional: the /brag-slim command
```

Restart Claude Code after copying.

### Also works with

This repo exposes the skill at every agent's standard discovery path via symlinks. No extra config needed.

| Agent | How it discovers |
|---|---|
| **Google Antigravity** | Auto-detects from `.agents/skills/brag/` at project root or `~/.gemini/config/skills/brag/` globally |
| **opencode** | Auto-detects from `.opencode/skills/brag/` at project root |
| **Codex CLI** | Reads `.agents/skills/brag/`, walking up to repo root |
| **Claude Code** | Also reads `.claude/skills/brag/` (in addition to the `.claude-plugin/` marketplace install above) |
| **Other agents** | Point custom instructions at `skills/brag/SKILL.md` — see [`docs/other-agents.md`](docs/other-agents.md) |

> **Windows users:** Git requires `git config core.symlinks true` (or `git clone -c core.symlinks=true`) and Windows Developer Mode or Administrator privileges to create symlinks. If symlinks don't work on your system, copy `skills/brag/` to the agent's skill directory manually instead.

## Use it

From any project directory, ask your agent:

```text
let's /brag
```

Or steer the tone:

```text
/brag --tone "fake Series A launch from 2016"
```

Voiceover is off by default. Enable it explicitly with:

```text
/brag --voice
```

Narration uses Kokoro through Hyperframes when enabled.

You get a `brag-output/` folder with the plan, a composition brief, share copy, and the rendered `brag.mp4`.

## How it works

`/brag` owns the story — the product angle, tone, and which moments to show. It hands a focused brief to [Hyperframes](https://hyperframes.heygen.com/), which builds, times, and renders the video.

## Requirements

- An agent that supports Agent Skills — Claude Code, opencode, Codex CLI, or any agent with custom instructions (see "Also works with" above)
- Node.js 22+
- FFmpeg on `PATH`
- Hyperframes CLI — `npx hyperframes` (check it with `npx hyperframes doctor`)

## What's in this repo

- `skills/brag/` — the skill, references, and bundled music + SFX
- `skills/brag-slim/` — `/brag-slim`, the single-file skill for Claude Opus 5.5
- `skills/dickerson-motion/` — the Dickerson Services motion skill: brand rules, approval gate, critique loop, three-format renders, beat analysis
- `examples/` — fake product sites used as a benchmark suite
- `docs/` — the launch site (GitHub Pages)
- `.claude-plugin/` — plugin manifest + marketplace catalog
- `.claude/skills/brag/` — symlink → `skills/brag/` (Claude Code discovery)
- `.agents/skills/brag/` — symlink → `skills/brag/` (Codex CLI + opencode discovery)
- `.opencode/skills/brag/` — symlink → `skills/brag/` (opencode discovery)
- `.claude/skills/dickerson-motion/`, `.agents/skills/dickerson-motion/`, `.opencode/skills/dickerson-motion/` — symlinks → `skills/dickerson-motion/`
